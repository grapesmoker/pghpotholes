    "description":"Going down the 1 block street of Lacona, the right-hand side of the road is rife with potholes from sewer cave ins or other drainage issues. The LEFT hand side, the curbs are all deteriorating from rain runoff over the years.  Lived here 5 years and as of yet, there's never been a comprehensive repair job performed anywhere on this block.   Many calls have been placed, but no one ever comes out to patch or repave this road.  Considering the light traffic it receives for only being one block long, you'd think a repair would last a LONG time.  residents have taken to making their OWN repair work with Sakrete, just to help keep the curb deterioration from ruining their driveways.  PLEASE, come fix this road!!!",
